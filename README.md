The project addresses various business requests related to identifying high-value discounted products, store distribution, campaign effectiveness, and product performance in terms of incremental sales and revenue.

## Introduction

Promotional campaigns play a crucial role in the retail industry, driving sales and attracting customers during festive seasons. This project aims to analyze the performance of promotional campaigns conducted by Ali Mart during Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024.

## Data Sources

The analysis is based on data obtained from Ali Mart's internal databases. The main datasets used include fact_events, dim_products, dim_stores, and sales_summary. These datasets contain information about product sales, store locations, promotional events, and campaign revenues.
## Limitations and Challenges

One significant limitation encountered during the analysis is related to the handling of promotions with the 'BOGOF' (Buy One Get One Free) promotion type. The dataset does not accurately account for the quantity of the free item provided as part of the promotion. This limitation may lead to some discrepancies or misunderstandings in the analysis, particularly when evaluating the effectiveness of 'BOGOF' promotions and comparing them with other promotion types.

## Results and Insights

The analysis revealed several key insights:

- High-value products featured in 'BOGOF' promotions.
- Distribution of stores across different cities.
- Total revenue generated before and after each promotional campaign.
- Incremental sold quantity and revenue percentage during the Diwali campaign.
- Top 5 products ranked by incremental revenue percentage.

These insights can help Ali Mart make informed decisions for future promotional activities, optimize resource allocation, and improve overall sales performance.
